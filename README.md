**Alpha Analyst Leveraging Unstructured Data**  
The development of computing power has led to the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, making it possible to utilize unstructured data—such as images or text—even in the financial field, which traditionally focused on structured data (e.g., stock prices, trading volume, moving averages, financial information). In particular, the recent attention on natural language processing, enabled by the development of the Transformer model's attention mechanism, has made it easier to apply directly to financial investment.

Unstructured data offers the advantage of being able to discover and reprocess ideas from a much broader perspective than existing structured data. However, the inconsistency in data processing and analysis methodologies can be challenging. I believe that overcoming this challenge actually provides a differentiated advantage for investors.

While unstructured data may not be straightforward to use directly in investments, it serves as a powerful tool for enhancing the investment process. Most of the projects I’ve worked on stem from my interest in how to incorporate various data structures into the investment workflow and test them in real-world scenarios.
