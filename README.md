**Alpha analyst leveraging unstructured data**  
The advancement of computing power has led to the rapid development of deep learning technology. This has made it possible to easily utilize unstructured data such as images or texts, which used to deal only with structured data such as stock prices, transaction volumes, and moving averages. In particular, natural language processing, which has recently been receiving attention, has become easy to directly apply to financial investment due to the development of the attention mechanism of the Transformer model. Such unstructured data has the advantage of being able to discover and reprocess ideas from a much more diverse perspective than existing structured data, but it also has the weakness of inconsistent data processing and analysis methodologies. In addition, although in the past when simply dealing with numbers, financial domain knowledge may not have been necessary, I think that today, when dealing with complex unstructured data including documents and images, an in-depth understanding of the financial field has become more important.
